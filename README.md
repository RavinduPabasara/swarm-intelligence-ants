# Ant Foraging Simulation

This project implements a simple simulation of ant foraging behavior using Pygame.

## Overview

The simulation consists of ants moving around a virtual environment containing food and a nest. The ants search for food, carry it back to the nest, and leave a pheromone trail to guide other ants. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ant-foraging-simulation.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
